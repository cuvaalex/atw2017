        description: "<p>During the year 2015 - 2016 I was hired to coach the IT centre of a state-owned insurance company to adopt Agile. Due to the heavily mutual dependent infrastructure, coaching a small team to adopt Agile (Scrum, Kanban, or whatever) doesn't make sense, so I chose to pull multiple teams into the transformation freeway.</p><p>People are very political in state-owned enterprises, and they don't have strong willingness to adopt new things, therefore it's extremely risky injecting Scrum or any Agile framework as a whole into the teams. I designed the transformation roadmap as:<ol><li>How to pull a leg (single team);</li><li>How to pull four legs (multiple product teams) to move;</li><li>How to pull the whole of the elephant (the IT centre);</li><li>How to move gracefully (using Design Thinking to improve User eXperience);</li><li>How to move stably (make Agile part of the organization culture).</li></ol></p><p>The transformation was in general a success (achieved both the expectation of the client and me). I summarize 5 tips in how to change a organization, which are good supplementaries to Lean-Agile scaling principles in implementing Agile transformation in scale.</p><p>In this 45-minutes talk I will share how I achieved the goals in the roadmap, the challenges and lessons learnt, and how to use the 5 tips to make your Agile journey easier and better.</p>"
